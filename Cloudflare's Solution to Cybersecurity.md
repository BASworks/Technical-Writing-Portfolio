# Cloudflare’s Solution to Cybersecurity

## Executive Summary
Today's markets exist in the digital world, which is a new and changing landscape for businesses to navigate. Just as there are increased opportunities for growth and diversification, there are also new dangers to look out for that can cost more than one might imagine if left unprepared. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) reports that a cyber attack occurs every 39 seconds, with small businesses constituting 43 percent of the victims. Cyber attacks have proliferated over the past decade, and the effects are devastating: millions in expenditures, premature  foreclosures, legal disputes, and mounting distrust in corporate entities. In fact, 43 percent of cyber attacks target small businesses, which can cost hundreds of thousands, or even millions, in restoration expenses. This is because they lack the resources to protect themselves from ransomware. On the other hand, if businesses can instill a sense of security with their client base, they can expect greater brand loyalty, more efficient data management, and a competitive edge. While it can be difficult to predict and prevent attacks, businesses can employ simple and effective measures to secure their data.

More than 1.6 million companies worldwide trust Cloudflare to secure their data. Many successful businesses already use cloudflare including Udemy, Lyft, Tinder, Walmart, Best Buy, Dell, Nike, H&M, and more. Cloudflare provides a multifaceted solution to security including DDoS safeguards, a web application firewall, email encryption, and cryptographic protocols such as TLS and SSL to ensure safe communications over computer networks. It also provides additional services designed to improve application responsiveness and availability such as load balancing and Cloudflare AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages). Cloudflare ensures confidentiality for both users and clients, integrity of its security systems, and information availability and accessibility for authorized parties. 

With Cloudflare’s fully cloud native platform, it is easier than ever to ensure a safe online experience.

About Cloudflare Services
There are a few factors that businesses have to keep in mind if they want to maintain their online services for a wide audience. They need to protect their servers, prioritize speed and efficiency, and organize their data. 

Cloudflare offers solutions for a range of challenges. A few of their services include:

### Domain Name System (DNS)
A DNS establishes an IP address for a web domain so that computers and network devices can identify it. Without it, end-users would not be able to access the host’s website. 



### Content Delivery Networks (CDN)
CDNs are specialized for web applications and services on a global scale, and are used to deliver web content to end-users as efficiently as possible. A CDN utilizes servers placed across the globe to cache and deliver content such as images, music, videos, and other media. 

Wide Area Network / Magic WAN (WAN-as-a-Service)
Although similar to a CDN, a WAN’s function is to establish internal communications and data transfers between public or private networks across a wide geographical area. 

### Load Balancing
Cloudflare utilizes reverse proxies to manage incoming client requests to backend web servers. Reverse proxies provide load balancing services, which are used to improve the performance of applications by redirecting traffic to the most available and responsive server pools. This mitigates latency and improves availability. 

## Magic Firewall 
A firewall sits between a private internal network and the public internet, and its role is to monitor and filter network traffic to ensure the security of the network. With Cloudflare's firewall-as-a-service (FWaaS), network security scales as needed, and can be managed through a single dashboard and policy management interface no matter where in the world the networks are located. 

## Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)
Accelerated Mobile Pages reformat web pages to be mobile-friendly, and are optimized to ensure a fast and responsive user experience. 

### Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Protection
Distributed Denial of Service attacks prevent users from accessing online services and sites by overloading servers with internet traffic. Cloudflare uses its Autonomous Edge technology to automatically detect and mitigate DDoS attacks. 

Millions of successful companies have taken full advantage of these tools to scale their business while maintaining their security and performance. For example, Discord adopted Cloudflare’s CDN to scale their user-base from twenty-five thousand to more than two million concurrent users all the while saving hundreds of thousands of dollars that would have been put toward hardware and software maintenance. 


### General Security Practices and Considerations
In addition to utilizing effective tools to counteract online threats, it is also imperative to adopt an extensive plan to monitor and improve security long-term. Simple measures may include implementing standards for strong passwords, mandating multi-factor authentication, and using VPNs when necessary. American Technology Services recommends businesses conduct regular security assessments and penetration tests to expose vulnerabilities, and provide security awareness training to their teams. CISA recommends appointing a Security Program Manager to provide expert oversight, and implementing an IRP (Incident Response Plan), which lays out best practices for dealing with a cyber threat before, during and after the incident. Of course, establishing an IT department should be a priority for every business that handles big data.
